# DATA 512 Human Centered Data Science Final Project

### Introduction
This is the repository for my final project in the DATA 512 Human Centered Data Science course (Autumn 2020, University of Washington, Master of Science in Data Science program). 
My project explores the relationship between female representation in politics and other factors that may affect gender parity. My specific research question and hypothesis are as follows:    

**Research Question: What factors are associated with countries with greater female representation in politics?**  

**Hypothesis: Countries with better performance across key gender parity indicators are more likely to have greater representation of women in politics.**

### Background
Globally, women account for barely one quarter of the representation in parliamentary/legislative bodies, and as of 2019, the [U.S. ranked 75th out of 193 world countries](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/04/the-us-ranks-75th-in-womens-representation-in-government.html) on the share of women in goverment. However, research shows that women perform just as well as men in elections, and the socio-economic benefits of greater female representation are well-documented. Therefore, the low number of women in govemerment may be attributed to systemic obstacles that hinder women from pursuing a path in politics. This project seeks to explore how key indicators of gender parity, like education, earnings, representation in the commercial sector, and maternity leave, may be associated with female representation in political bodies.
