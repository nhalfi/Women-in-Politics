## DATA 512 Human Centered Data Science Final Project
This is the repository for my final project in the DATA 512 Human Centered Data Science course (Autumn 2020, University of Washington, Master of Science in Data Science program). 
My project explores the relationship between female representation in politics and other factors that may affect gender parity. My specific research question and hypothesis are as follows:    

### Research Question  
**What factors are associated with countries with greater female representation in politics?**  

### Hypothesis  
**Countries with better performance across key gender parity indicators are more likely to have greater representation of women in politics.**

### Data Source  
I am leveraging data from the OECD website database: https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=54760#
